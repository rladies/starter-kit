#-----------------------------------------------------------#
# Goal: Update the "Current-Chapters.csv" programmatically
# Details about this script:
# 1) Update the meetup url
# function: add_meetup_url
# 2) Filter chapters where status is prospect. Check it has a meetup url. 
# If it does then change the status to be active
# function: change_status_to_progress

# 'active'- has had an event in the last 4 months
# 'active quiet'- hasn't had an event in the last 4 months
# 'in-progress' - has a meetup account, is planning or has had its launch event 
# but is yet to have its first R training/presentation event.
# 'prospect' - is in the planning stage is not set up on meetup.com yet.
