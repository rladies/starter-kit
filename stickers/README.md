## Files

Usually every sticker printer asks for a sticker with some bleed. But there is no *custom* bleed area (outside margin) so the png has none.

The psd has a bleed area (3mm, and it is an editable file so you can customize the area) but I know Photoshop is not free, so if you need a special bleed area I'll be happy to export one customized in png. Consult with the company you are using to print the stickers.

Every file with *hex-* has hex dimensions (see [StickerConstructorSpec](https://github.com/terinjokes/StickerConstructorSpec)).

- [hex-only_logo.png]() is a png with **no bleed area** and hex dimensions.
- [hex-only_logo_3mmbleed.psd]() is a editable psd with a 3mm bleed area and the sticker has hex dimensions..
