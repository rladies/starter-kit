# @WeAreRLadies: Curator Guide  
  
  
## About
  
The **[R-Ladies RoCur (Rotating Curation)](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies)** is a twitter handle that will feature an awesome R-Lady each week. This account is run by R-Ladies Global.      
  
  
   
## Objectives  
  
1. To encourage and maintain Twitter engagement within the R-Ladies community.    
2. To spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in R.   
  
  
   
## How Curating Works  
  
* Curatorship begins each **Monday at 7:00 AM ET** and ends the following **Saturday at 12:00 PM ET**.   
* For the duration of the curatorship, the profile photo will be a photo of the curator. This is updated by the RoCur administrator.    
* The personal twitter handle of the curator will be in the bio (if applicable, you do not need to be a twitter user prior to curating).   
* Your first post should introduce yourself to the account followers. Your first tweet should tell the audience: what you do (your job, hobbies, etc.), and what you do in R. You may want to pin this tweet so it stays at the top of the feed throughout the week.   
* Tweet throughout the week! We do not require that you tweet a specific number of times. But, we ask that you be as active as your schedule allows during your curatorship.  
* Every Sunday, the administrator will update access of the account for the next curator via Tweetdeck.

## Tweeting Tips  
  
### Introducing Yourself  
  
Start your curatorship by introducing yourself, what you do (your job, hobbies, etc.), and what you do in R.   
  
Suggestions on how to introduce yourself:    
  
* Share a URL to your website or github or etc.  
* If your photo on the account differs from the photo on your personal twitter account, post the photo of your personal twitter account.  
  
  
### General Tweeting Guidelines   
  
* We do not require that you tweet a specific number of times. But, we ask that you be as active as your schedule allows during your curatorship.    
* The content of your tweets is all up to you! But keep it relevant to R and/or R-Ladies. Make the account and its tweets useful for learning.   
* Tweet pictures/graphics whenever possible.  
    + Posting photos from R-Ladies meetups or other R-related events is highly encouraged.  
    + Please properly attribute your photos and graphics by asking permission from the source if not you and tagging the individual if able.  
    + Tag individuals who are in the photos if able.  
* Use hashtags! (See below, [Tweeting about R](#tweeting-about-r), for more information on this)   
* Add emojis and gifs when appropriate :smile:   
* Have Fun!   
  
  
### Tweeting about R    
    
* If you are part of an R-Ladies Chapter, highlight a project your local chapter is working on.  
* Share relevant articles, blog posts, etc. relevant to your work or interests in R.    
* Tell us something you just learned about R.  
* Tell followers about a current R project you are doing (share a line of code or dataviz, link to a package you use a lot).    
* When mentioning a package, add a link to its CRAN/BioConductor/GitHub page.   
    + If possible, tag the Twitter account of the maintainer if this person isn’t too famous yet (e.g. no need to link and tag Hadley Wickham when mentioning ggplot2).   
    + Same goes for courses, books, and etc.   
* Use hashtags whenever possible.  
    + Use the hashtag **#RLadies** whenever possible and relevant.  
    + Use the **#rstats** hashtag when you share something that can be useful for the greater R community (e.g. a cool package); however, don’t use it when saying “Oh I’m doing R look at my screen” because this would create clutter in the R hashtag timeline and potentially lead to people blocking/silencing the account which we do not want. :wink:      
  + Some other hashtag examples: **#dataviz, #rspatial, #opendata**    
  + You can also hashtag: package names, the location of your local chapter, etc.
  
  
### Interacting with your audience  
  
One goal of @WeAreRLadies is to maintain a strong R-Ladies community on Twitter! Therefore, please respond to people who interact with the account.   
  
If someone asks a question, we suggest re-tweeting their question with your response as a comment so that others can see the original question.  
  
  
*Other suggestions for interacting with your audience:*  
  
* Ask a question about something you are having trouble with in R (our community is all about helping and supporting each other).  
* Ask for recommendations on packages/datasets/features in R for a project you are working on.  
* Create a twitter poll for followers to respond to. *Please note: You cannot create a twitter poll in Tweetdeck. We recommend creating a poll on your personal account and retweeting it via @WeAreRLadies.*  
  
  
  
## Promotional Tweeting   
  
**It is not permitted to promote companies and/or businesses through @WeAreRLadies.**   
  
On this account, promoting a company, business, or service is broadly defined as any instance where any entity receives financial benefit from the twitter post. This includes:  
  
  
* If you, the curator, receives remuneration for posting about a specific company, business, or service (including referral links).   
*	If an organization, company, or individual receives profit from individuals using their service (i.e. users would have to pay for the service).  
*	If the post actively solicits followers to partake in services where an entity receives financial benefit.  
  
  
Examples of promotional tweets that are not allowed include:  
  
*	“Buy this book about XYZ in R!”   
*	“Here is an online course that might be useful”  
   
   
We encourage @WeAreRLadies curators to share free, openly-available resources to our audience and share personal experiences about using specific resources without promoting or soliciting on behalf of any particular company, business or service. This includes:  
  
*	Discussing an open source package that you use and why it’s helpful.  
*	Discussing what you use R for at your job.   
*	Sharing free, openly-available resources that you used to learn R and explaining what you liked and disliked about this resource.  

Examples include:  
  
*	“As my job at [company name], I do/learn/use XYZ in R”  
*	“An awesome package I use for XYZ in R is [package name]. [function name] is especially useful for ABC (includes example)”  
*	“My first introduction to XYZ was this blog post: URL”
