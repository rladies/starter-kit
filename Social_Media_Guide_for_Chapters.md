# Social Media Guide

January 2018 

## We love to raise our voices about the R-ladies community 

### Should my chapter participate in social media?

* Social media accounts are a commitment. However there are many benefits that come from creating an local R-Ladies Chapter account.
* R-Ladies dominant social media channel is Twitter. We have a global Twitter account ([https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal)), and most R-Ladies chapters have their own Twitter account (e.g., [https://twitter.com/RLadiesLondon]).

### What are the benefits of using social media?

* Raising the voices of R-Ladies.
* For chapter organisers and R-Ladies within the group, new opportunities and networks both locally and globally are shared and communicated. 
* Find R-Ladies around the world. 
* Find R content using <span style="color:blue"> <u>#stats</u>.  </span>
* Find R-Ladies content using <span style="color:blue"> <u>#rladies</u>.  </span>


### Getting started

Social media use guidelines and code of conduct:

* The chapter accounts should be used to promote:

    + The work (e.g. open source projects, blog posts, academic research) of individual R-Ladies.
    + R-Ladies events and announcements for your chapter.
    + Tutorials or R-related resources that you think are really great even if they’re not written by an R-Lady.
* Please tag all your tweets with the #rladies hashtag. This makes them searchable and more visible.
* On tagging @RLadiesGlobal: please do that if you are referring to the global organisation. If you want to refer to R-Ladies in general, please use the hashtag.
* Please add further hashtags to #rladies in the following situations:
    + If your chapter has a visitor from another chapter, please take a photo and share
it on Twitter using the hashtag,  <span style="color:#873989"> <u>#rladiesvisits</u>.  </span>
    + If you are tweeting about R-Ladies in Latin America, please consider adding <span style="color:blue"> <u>#RLadiesLatAm</u>.  </span>
* We encourage posting photos from events!
* We love images, animated gifs and emojis as a form of expression!
* Feel free to retweet posts by others that promote R-Ladies’ work and events as well.
* We love images, animated gifs and emojis as a form of expression!
* Feel free to retweet posts by others that promote R-Ladies’ work and events as well.
* Do not use your chapter account as a personal account: no personal tweets or massive self-promotion
    + When tweeting, do not use the word “I”, always use “we”
    + It’s okay to promote the #rstats related work/projects of R-Ladies, including yourself, just don’t over-do it and don’t promote work that’s not directly related to R or R-Ladies.
    + No selfies (we encourage group pictures instead).
* Do not make political statements with your chapter account. Please use your personal Twitter for political speech.
    + Feminist or women-in-tech related topics are okay, but please stay away from traditional politics, as that can be divisive to the community and R-Ladies is a non-partisan organization.
* Do not promote products or any other commercial offerings.
    + Promoting open source R projects that are backed by a company (e.g., RStudio) is okay.
    + Thanking a meetup host/sponsor for their support is okay.
* Always speak positively about people’s work, e.g., “Tidyverse is awesome!” instead of “Tidyverse is better than base R!”
